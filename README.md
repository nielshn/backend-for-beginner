# Experience in Completing the Backend Course

During my journey through the backend course, I encountered a deeply immersive and rewarding learning experience. Here's an overview of my experience throughout the course:

## Comprehensive Introduction
I deeply appreciated the comprehensive introduction to the roles of front-end and back-end in web application development. Understanding how clients and servers communicate via the HTTP protocol and the architecture of RESTful APIs provided me with a solid understanding of web technology fundamentals.

## Understanding Node.js Basics
The material covering the basics of Node.js was incredibly helpful in grasping fundamental concepts such as global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), eventing, filesystem, and stream techniques. This thorough introduction laid a strong foundation for further learning.

## Building Web Services with Node.js
I enjoyed the process of building web services using Node.js, both natively and through the Hapi framework. With this material, I was able to implement simple RESTful APIs and understand best practices in backend development.

## Experience Deploying Web Services
Getting to know and utilize Amazon EC2, as well as running RESTful APIs on this platform, provided me with practical experience in the deployment process. Understanding how to operate Amazon EC2 via SSH was invaluable knowledge for managing web applications in a production environment.

## Using Postman for API Testing
Learning to use Postman to consume and test RESTful APIs was incredibly beneficial for me. I gained an understanding of how to perform manual testing of API functionalities and write automated test scenarios using Postman.

## Final Project
Completing the final project in the form of a Bookshelf API gave me the opportunity to apply everything I learned in this course. I felt satisfied being able to create a well-functioning backend application with Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities.

My experience in completing this backend course has provided me with a deep understanding of backend technology and practical skills in web application development. I am confident that this experience will serve as a strong foundation in my career as a backend developer.
